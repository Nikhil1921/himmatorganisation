            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>HimmatOrganisation takes the utmost care to process donations as
              per the instructions given by our donors, online and offline.
              However, in case of an unlikely event of an erroneous donation or
              if the donor would like to cancel his donation, Himmat will
              respond to the donor within 7 working days of receiving a valid
              request for refund from the donor. The timely refund of the
              donation will depend upon the type of credit card/banking
              instrument used during the transaction. The donor will have to
