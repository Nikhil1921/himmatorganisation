                                <p>You have no continuing right to use the Site and we may deny or suspend access, or terminate or cancel this agreement with or without cause and at any time and without a prior written notice. Termination or cancellation
                                    will not terminate/eliminate any provisions that would be expected to survive termination by their nature, and shall continue to remain in full force and effect. An unauthorized use of the Site by you shall terminate
                                    the permission or license granted to you under these Terms and you agree that you shall not bypass any measures used by the Foundation to prevent or restrict access to the Site.</p>

                                <h3>1. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>

                                <p>These Terms, including the Privacy Policy (including any of the supplemental privacy policies), amendments and any: (a) notices, terms and items incorporated into any of them; (b) additional terms and conditions contained
                                    on the Site for particular activities or Content; and (c) our disclosures and your consents provided on or in connection with the Site or any Content, service or other activity; constitute the entire agreement between
                                    you and the Foundation regarding the Site or the subject matter of the foregoing (“Entire Agreement”). Foundation’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of Entire Agreement shall not operate as a waiver
                                    of such right or provision. If any provision of the Entire Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified
                                    so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Foundation is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. Entire Agreement,
                                    and your rights and obligations therein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Foundation’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation,
                                    or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The foregoing does not impair the enforceability of additional agreements you may enter into such as an agreement for a grant. You may print or make an
                                    electronic copy of the Entire Agreement for your official records; and, to the extent required by law, we hereby instruct you to do so. You shall not assign these Terms or any of your rights or obligations under these
                                    Terms without our prior written consent.
                                </p>
